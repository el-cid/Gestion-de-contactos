# Gestión de contactos
This contact manager allows you to import contacts from a VCF 2.1 file into a database and to export your contacts into a new VCF 2.1 encoded file. It includes a simple GUI, a SQL script to deploy the database and the source code. This program doesn´t fully support the VCF 2.1 standard, it is only able to handle addressess, emails, telephones and names.
